Overview
======
In parallel of my graduate studies, I grade a class of 70 IEOR juniors and seniors for homework, lab quizzes and exams throughout the fall semester. The course IEOR 115 at Berkeley focuses on database design an implementation, with an emphasis on industrial and commercial applications. The students learn the relational database model and the mathematics of relational algebra and Structured Query Language (SQL). Laboratory sessions use Microsoft Access and students work in teams to design and implement working prototype databases for local organizations.
