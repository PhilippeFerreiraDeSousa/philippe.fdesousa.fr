Iâ€™m Philippe, a French graduate student in Financial Engineering at UC Berkeley.
I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in Paris.
At that time I focused on projects of Machine Learning, Computer Science and image processing.
During my internship year last year I worked as full stack developer at Illuin Technology, an AI company in Paris.
I built chat-bots as well as an ecosystem to configure them, train them, annotate them and deploy them to several platforms.

Then eager to discover the world, I went to Hong Kong to build high frequency trading automatons at Laplace Research Capital,
connecting several trading strategies to several exchanges and products in real-time.
I worked on data collection and processing to make custom orderbooks for quantitative research.
Now at UC Berkeley, I keep studying Machine Learning, Optimization and FinTech as well as Robotics, Embedded Systems and Integrated Circuits.
I am currently looking for tech job opportunities in the Silicon Valley and more broadly in the US.
