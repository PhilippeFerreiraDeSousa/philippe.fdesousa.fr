Iâ€™m Philippe, a French graduate student in Data Science at UC Berkeley, where I am studying Machine Learning, Optimization and FinTech as well as Robotics, Embedded Systems and Integrated Circuits. In parallel I am still enrolled in my master program in my home country in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in Paris, where I focused on Machine Learning, Computer Science and image processing.

Last year, while interning at Illuin Tech (an AI company in Paris) as a full stack developer, I built chat-bots as well as an ecosystem to configure them, train them, annotate them and deploy them to several platforms.

Eager to discover the world, I went to Hong Kong to build high frequency trading automatons at Laplace Research Capital, connecting trading strategies to exchanges and products in real-time. I also worked on data collection and processing to make custom orderbooks for quantitative research. I am currently looking for tech job.

I am currently looking for tech job opportunities in the Silicon Valley and more broadly in the US.
