Iâ€™m Philippe, a new graduate from UC Berkeley developing software for an enthusiastic startup in the Bay Area. I did my undergraduate in Mathematics and Computer Science at the Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in Paris. At that time I focused on projects of machine learning, computer science and image processing.

Last year, while interning at Illuin Tech (an AI company in Paris) as a full stack developer, I built chat-bots as well as an ecosystem to configure them, train them, annotate them and deploy them to several platforms.

Then eager to discover the world, I went to Hong Kong to build high frequency trading automatons at Laplace Research Capital, connecting trading strategies to exchanges and products in real-time. I also worked on data collection and processing to make custom orderbooks for quantitative research.

Finally at UC Berkeley, I kept studying machine learning and FinTech as well as robotics, computer architecture, embedded systems and integrated circuits. I have now landed my first full-time tech job at JITx, a skillful startup around the Silicon Valley.


You can enjoy my first Medium article <a href="https://medium.com/@philippe.fdesousa/the-place-of-robots-in-society-c78278cdfbdc" target="_blank">here</a> that discusses recent developments in robotics and the future assimilation of robots in our daily lives.
Finally my robotics project on collaborative trajectory tracking and multi-robot control is available <a href="https://fdesousa.fr/balebot/" target="_blank">here</a>.
