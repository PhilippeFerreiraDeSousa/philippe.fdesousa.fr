Overview
======
uPont version 3.0 is the intranet of the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées. It is a project launched by Charles BOCHET, President of promotion 2015, during his scientific training course. It is the most ambitious project led by the IT club. It aims at gathering as many features and information as possible related to the associative life of the engineering school in a great website. Clubs can write their presentations directly on uPont, create events without being moderated on mailing lists, interact with students. Students can choose the content they want to be filled in on not to miss anything relevant to them. It features an AngularJS front-end powered by a Symfony4 REST API.
